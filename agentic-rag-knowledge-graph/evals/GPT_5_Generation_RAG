Below is a ready-to-submit application (structured to fit the DSA data access portal workflow) to request access to data from the provider of the Facebook platform for a research project on exposure to “filter bubbles.”

Title: Application for data access under DSA Article 40 for research on exposure to “filter bubbles” on Facebook

1) Applicant and affiliation (DSA Article 40(8)(a))
- Principal investigator: [Name, title]
- Institution (research organisation): [Name, address, legal form]
- Department/Center: [Name]
- Contact: [Email, phone]
- Team members: [Names, roles] (list all individuals to be included, to enable their inclusion in the reasoned request if needed)
- Proof of affiliation attached.

2) Independence, conflicts of interest, funding (DSA Article 40(8)(b)–(c))
- Independence from commercial interests: We confirm we are independent from commercial interests.
- Conflicts of interest: We declare no relevant conflicts of interest; individual COI statements attached.
- Funding disclosure: [Sources, amounts, grant numbers, any conditions]. All funding sources disclosed in full.

3) Research purpose and relevance to systemic risks (DSA Article 40(4))
- Purpose: To detect, identify, and understand how algorithmic curation and social graph dynamics on Facebook may contribute to users’ exposure to ideologically narrow content (“filter bubbles”) and to assess the adequacy and impacts of risk mitigation measures.
- Relevance to systemic risks: The project contributes to the detection, identification, and understanding of systemic risks in the Union, as referenced in DSA Article 40(4) with respect to research aligned with Article 34(1). We will specifically evaluate whether platform recommender systems and related features materially concentrate information exposure in ways that may affect civic discourse and information integrity, and how mitigation measures affect such risks.

4) Research questions and hypotheses
- RQ1: To what extent do Facebook’s content ranking and recommendation systems concentrate users’ exposure to ideologically homogeneous or biased information?
- RQ2: How do product changes and policy/enforcement measures alter exposure diversity over time?
- RQ3: Are there measurable differences in exposure diversity across Member States, languages, and user segments?
- Hypotheses: H1: Exposure distributions for a material share of users are highly concentrated within narrow ideological bands; H2: Recommender changes and enforcement interventions can measurably widen exposure diversity.

5) Methodology overview and requested data (necessity and proportionality; DSA Article 40(8)(e), (f); 40(7))
- Design: Observational analysis of exposure logs combined with content metadata and recommender-system change logs; quasi-experimental analysis of platform changes; analysis of public content signals.
- Primary outcome measures: Exposure diversity indices (e.g., source diversity, viewpoint diversity), temporal shifts following policy/product changes, and cross-market comparisons.
- Data requested from the Facebook platform provider (scoped to what is necessary and proportionate):
  a) Exposure and ranking data:
    - Anonymized/impression-level or session-level exposure logs indicating which items were shown to users (with user IDs pseudonymized and access via a secure processing environment), including timestamps and delivery surfaces (e.g., Feed, Groups, Watch).
    - Ranking metadata for exposed items sufficient to assess exposure drivers (e.g., rank position, ranking score components/categories).
  b) Content and account metadata:
    - Public content metadata for exposed items (e.g., Page/group/post IDs, language, creation time, content category, policy labels such as fact-check flags, where applicable).
    - Page/Group attributes relevant to provenance and topic classification (non-sensitive; sufficient to evaluate diversity).
  c) System and policy context:
    - Recommender and policy change logs (high-level changelogs and timestamps) to support quasi-experimental identification.
  d) Public data (DSA Article 40(12)):
    - Programmatic access to publicly accessible content and associated public metadata (including, where technically possible, near real-time signals) for comparative baselines and topic/label coverage.
- Time frame and geographic scope:
  - Time frame: [Specify start/end, e.g., 12 months] to capture pre/post changes and seasonal effects.
  - Markets/languages: [List relevant EU Member States/languages] to permit cross-market comparisons while maintaining proportionality.
- Sampling and minimization:
  - Where full-population data are not necessary, we will use statistically representative samples.
  - We will prefer aggregated/derived signals if sufficient for valid inference, and will restrict to fields strictly necessary for research aims.

6) Access modalities requested (DSA Article 40(7); Delegated Regulation Recital (17), Article 9(1)–(2))
- Preferred modality: Access via a secure processing environment operated by the provider or an approved third party, with strict on-site analysis, role-based access controls, auditing, and non-exfiltration of raw personal data; export limited to vetted, privacy-preserving aggregate statistics and models.
- Alternative/additional modality: Read-only APIs or data interfaces for specified endpoints, with rate limits, privacy controls, and data minimization.
- We request the Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) determine the appropriate legal, technical, and organisational modalities and specify them in the reasoned request, including any requirements for cross-border data transfers if applicable.

7) Data protection, security, and confidentiality (DSA Article 40(8)(d); Delegated Regulation Recital (17))
- Security measures: Strong authentication; least-privilege role-based access; encryption at rest/in transit; audit logging; monitored secure environment; no raw personal data extraction; privacy-preserving aggregation; reproducible pipelines.
- GDPR compliance: We will conduct/maintain a DPIA and implement pseudonymization, data minimization, purpose limitation, and retention/deletion schedules aligned with the provider’s secure environment and DSC instructions.
- Confidentiality: All team members will sign confidentiality and acceptable-use undertakings as required.

8) Necessity and proportionality (DSA Article 40(8)(e))
- The requested data elements are limited to what is essential to detect, identify, and understand exposure concentration and to evaluate mitigation measures.
- Time frame and sampling are scoped to minimize data volume while preserving statistical power.

9) Public interest and dissemination (DSA Article 40(8)(f)–(g))
- Contribution: Results will inform risk assessments and mitigation strategies relevant to systemic risks under the DSA framework.
- Publication commitment: We commit to making research results publicly available free of charge within a reasonable period after completion, subject to the rights and interests of service recipients and data protection obligations.

10) Documentation and support requested from the provider (Delegated Regulation Article 15(2))
- To enable correct interpretation and robust analysis, we request relevant documentation such as:
  - Codebooks for fields delivered via interfaces,
  - Changelogs (product/policy/recommender changes),
  - Architectural documentation sufficient to understand data lineage and constraints,
  - Any additional information necessary to access and understand the data.

11) Team roster for inclusion in the reasoned request (Delegated Regulation Article 10(2))
- List of all vetted researchers who require access, with names and contact details:
  - [Name, role, email, phone]
  - [Add all team members]

12) Cross-border personal data transfers (if applicable) (Delegated Regulation Article 10(3))
- If access involves transfers to a third country or international organisation within the meaning of GDPR Chapter V, we request the DSC specify appropriate transfer mechanisms and safeguards in the reasoned request.

13) Timeline and milestones
- Account creation and submission via the DSA data access portal.
- Vetting and reasoned request issuance by DSC.
- Environment setup and access provisioning.
- Analysis phases: baseline exposure diversity, change-impact analysis, cross-market comparisons.
- Draft and final publications; public release of aggregated findings and reproducible code where permissible.

14) Attachments
- Proof of affiliation (institution letter).
- CVs of all researchers and roles.
- Funding disclosure and COI statements.
- Data Management Plan (incl. DPIA summary).
- Security and confidentiality policy.
- Ethics approval or confirmation of exemption (if applicable).

Notes on process
