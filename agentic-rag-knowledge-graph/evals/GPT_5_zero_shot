If you’re in the EU and want to access VLOP (Very Large Online Platform) data for research under the DSA (Digital Services Act), here’s a breakdown of what you’ll need to submit and what conditions you must satisfy. (This is what is known publicly as of mid-2025.)

Legal & institutional framework

Under Article 40 of the DSA, VLOPs (and VLOSEs) are required to provide researchers access to platform data under certain conditions.

Access comes in two flavors:

Public data (Article 40(12)) — data already publicly available via the platform’s interface

Non-public data via a “vetted researcher” status (Article 40(4)–(11))

A Delegated Act under the DSA, adopted in 2025, defines procedural and technical details for the non-public data access route.

There is now a DSA Data Access Portal where researchers register, file applications, and track decisions.
