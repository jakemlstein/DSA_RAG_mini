Where and how to submit
- Submit your application via the DSA data access portal to the DSC of establishment; alternatively, you may submit to the DSC of your research organisation’s Member State, which will perform an initial assessment and forward it to the DSC of establishment, who takes the decision on awarding vetted researcher status. (DSA Art 40(9); Delegated Regulation Art 2(1); Art 3(5))

Notes on review and next steps (for context)
- The DSC of establishment decides whether your application satisfies Article 40(8) conditions (affiliation, independence, funding disclosure, safeguards, necessity/proportionality, research purpose, open publication commitment). (DSA Art 40(8))
