**1. Research Project Title:**
Investigating Exposure to "Filter Bubbles" and Information Bias on Facebook

**2. Research Objective:**
This research project aims to understand the mechanisms and extent of "filter bubble" phenomena on the Facebook platform, specifically analyzing how algorithmic content curation may lead to individuals being exposed to a biased sample of information. The study will investigate the impact of these exposure patterns on user perceptions, information diversity, and potential societal implications.

**3. Legal Basis for Request:**
This application for data access is made under the provisions of the Digital Services Act (DSA), which facilitates data access for vetted researchers. We understand that the DSA data access portal streamlines the management of this process, supporting both researchers and data providers.

**4. Data Requirements:**
To achieve the stated research objectives, we require access to the following categories of anonymized and/or pseudonymized data from Facebook users within the European Union, specifically pertaining to their interactions with content:

*   **Content Exposure Logs:** Records of content (posts, articles, videos) displayed to users, including information on the source and type of content.
*   **Interaction Data:** Anonymized metrics on user engagement (e.g., likes, shares, comments, viewing duration) with the exposed content.
*   **Demographic Data (Aggregated/Pseudonymized):** Broad, non-identifiable demographic categories (e.g., age ranges, geographic region at a broad level) to allow for stratification of analysis without compromising individual privacy.
*   **Algorithmic Ranking Signals (if feasible and anonymized):** High-level, anonymized indicators of factors that influenced content presentation, where such disclosure does not reveal proprietary algorithms but aids in understanding exposure bias.

We understand that data providers suggest access modalities for the data, including technical, organizational, and legal conditions appropriate for data provision (as per Article b064ed17-9969-4620-9f73-d27fd3030bb9). We are prepared to discuss and adhere to these conditions to ensure responsible data handling.

**5. Methodology:**
Our research will employ [specific research methods, e.g., quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, content analysis] to analyze the requested data. The focus will be on identifying patterns of content exposure, assessing the diversity of information received by different user groups, and correlating these patterns with potential indicators of filter bubble effects.

**6. Data Protection and Security Measures:**
All data obtained will be handled with the highest standards of data protection and security. We commit to:
*   Storing data on secure, encrypted servers.
*   Implementing strict access controls, limiting data access only to approved research personnel.
*   Anonymizing or pseudonymizing data to the maximum extent possible before analysis to protect user privacy.
*   Destroying or returning the data upon completion of the research project, as per agreed-upon terms.
*   Adhering to all relevant data protection regulations, including GDPR, and any specific technical, organizational, and legal conditions set by Facebook for data provision.

**7. Public Interest and Societal Benefit:**
The proposed research is of significant public interest. Understanding "filter bubbles" is crucial for fostering informed public discourse, mitigating the spread of misinformation, and enhancing digital literacy. The findings will be made publicly available through academic publications and presentations, contributing to a better understanding of online information environments and potentially informing policy and platform design aimed at promoting a healthier information ecosystem.

**8. Declaration:**
We confirm that we are vetted researchers and agree to comply with all terms and conditions set forth by Facebook and the DSA data access framework. We understand that the DSA data access portal facilitates information exchanges among vetted researchers and that data providers provide access to data for vetted researchers (as per Article 2f6b9d9a-6f82-4d70-9666-8e4074ac1528). We also acknowledge that DSA data catalogues do not bind or limit applicant researchers in their data access applications (as per Article ea13cac5-d2d0-40ab-a79c-1daaf995c02a).

We look forward to your positive consideration of this application and are available to provide any further information or clarification required.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Lead Researcher Name]
