1. Legal Basis for Request

This application is submitted under Article 40 of the EU Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065), which grants vetted researchers access to data from Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) for the purpose of conducting research that contributes to the detection, identification, and understanding of systemic risks, including those related to disinformation, algorithmic amplification, and societal polarization.
2. Research Project Overview

Title:
Understanding Filter Bubbles: Measuring Biased Information Exposure on Facebook

Objective:
The project seeks to empirically evaluate how Facebook’s content recommendation and ranking systems contribute to “filter bubbles”—environments in which individuals are exposed primarily to ideologically or emotionally homogeneous information.

We aim to:

    Quantify the diversity of information exposure across political, cultural, and social dimensions.

    Assess whether personalization mechanisms amplify or mitigate ideological segregation.

    Identify systemic risks related to disinformation, polarization, and public discourse fragmentation.

3. Public Interest Justification

This research directly addresses systemic risks identified in Article 34(1) of the DSA, specifically:

    The dissemination of illegal content and disinformation,

    Adverse effects on democratic processes, public security, and civic discourse,

    The protection of fundamental rights, including freedom of expression and information pluralism.

The study’s outcomes will inform policymakers, civil society, and platform governance debates about algorithmic transparency and the societal impact of personalized content delivery.
4. Requested Data Access

We request access to anonymized and aggregate-level data sufficient to analyze the diversity of information exposure patterns across users. Specifically:
Data Category	Requested Fields / Description	Purpose
Content exposure logs	Post IDs, Page IDs, timestamps, engagement type (view, like, share), and anonymized user-level exposure data	Measure information diversity and exposure networks
Content metadata	Source page type, topic category, political orientation (if available), engagement statistics	Assess bias and topical segmentation
Recommendation and ranking metadata	Information on content delivery parameters (algorithmic weighting or ranking labels where available)	Evaluate systemic amplification biases
Demographic aggregates	Age group, gender, country, language (aggregated and anonymized)	Control for demographic confounders
Public Page and Group content archives	Posts and associated metadata from politically or socially oriented public Pages/Groups	Analyze content ecosystems contributing to filter bubbles

We are not requesting personally identifiable information (PII) or direct access to user accounts. All analyses will comply with data protection standards, including GDPR.
5. Data Protection and Ethical Compliance

    The project will be conducted under the ethical oversight of [University / Institute]’s Research Ethics Committee.

    Data will be stored securely and processed only within the EU.

    Results will be reported only in aggregated and anonymized form.

    We will comply fully with Article 40(12) of the DSA regarding confidentiality, data protection, and responsible use.
