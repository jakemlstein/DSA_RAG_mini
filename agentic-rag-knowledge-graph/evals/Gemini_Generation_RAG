Subject: Application for Data Access under the Digital Services Act for Research on "Filter Bubbles"

Dear Digital Services Coordinator,

I am submitting this application for access to data from Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc.) under Article 40 of the Digital Services Act (DSA) for a research project titled "Quantifying and Mitigating Exposure to Filter Bubbles on Social Media."

**1. Research Project Overview:**

This research project aims to investigate the phenomenon of "filter bubbles" on social media platforms, specifically focusing on how individual users' exposure to information is shaped by algorithmic content recommendations and their social networks. We seek to quantify the extent of content exposure bias and its impact on user perceptions and attitudes. The ultimate goal is to identify systemic risks associated with filter bubbles, contribute to the understanding of their formation and impact, and inform the development of effective mitigation strategies.

**2. Justification for Data Access:**

Access to specific data from Facebook is indispensable for this research. "Filter bubbles" are a direct consequence of platform functionalities such as content personalization and recommendation algorithms, which are opaque without direct data access. The requested data will enable us to:

*   **Analyze individual-level content exposure and engagement histories:** This includes data on posts, articles, and other content users are exposed to, as well as their interactions (likes, shares, comments). This is directly relevant to understanding "individual-level content exposure and engagement histories" as described in Recital (13) of the DSA Access Delegated Regulation.
*   **Examine data related to content recommendations:** This includes data used to personalize recommendations, as mentioned in Recital (13). Understanding these inputs is crucial for identifying the mechanisms driving filter bubble formation.
*   **Investigate relationship networks:** As stated in Recital (13), data related to "relationship networks" is essential for understanding how social connections contribute to information silos.
*   **Assess the targeting of advertisements and profiling:** While not the primary focus, understanding advertising exposure and profiling data, as highlighted in Recital (13), can provide additional context on how information landscapes are constructed for users.

**3. Necessity and Proportionality of Requested Data:**

The requested data is strictly necessary and proportionate to the research purpose. We require granular, individual-level data to accurately model and measure filter bubble effects. Aggregate or publicly available data would be insufficient as it lacks the detail required to understand individual exposure pathways and the subtle biases introduced by algorithmic systems.

**4. Vetted Researcher Status:**

We are committed to meeting all conditions for "vetted researcher" status as outlined in Article 40, paragraph 8, of the DSA. We will provide all necessary documentation to demonstrate our independence, expertise, and commitment to data protection and ethical research practices. Our research contributes directly to the "detection, identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union pursuant to Article 34(1)," specifically regarding the societal impact of biased information exposure.

**5. Data Format and Access Mechanism:**

We request access to data through appropriate interfaces, including online databases or application programming interfaces (APIs), as specified in Article 40, paragraph 7, of the DSA. Where technically feasible, real-time data access would be highly beneficial to capture dynamic changes in content exposure (Article 40, paragraph 12). We are prepared to work with Facebook's technical teams to ensure secure and efficient data transfer.

We are confident that this research will provide valuable insights into a critical systemic risk within the online environment and contribute to a safer and more transparent digital space for European citizens. We look forward to your favorable consideration of this application.

Sincerely,
