- For each applicant researcher:
  - Proof of affiliation to a “research organisation” (as defined in Directive (EU) 2019/790) (DSA Art. 40(8)(a); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(a)(i)).
  - A declaration of independence from commercial interests relevant to the project (DSA Art. 40(8)(b); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(a)(ii)).
  - A commitment to make the research results publicly available free of charge within a reasonable period (DSA Art. 40(8)(g); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(a)(iii)).
- Disclosure of research funding for the project (DSA Art. 40(8)(c); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(b)).
- A detailed description of the data requested: format, scope, specific attributes, relevant metadata and data documentation (Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(c)).
- An explanation of necessity and proportionality of the requested access and the research time frames (DSA Art. 40(8)(e); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(d)).
- Identification of confidentiality, security and personal-data risks and a description of the technical, legal and organisational measures to mitigate them; include suggested access modalities if possible (Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(e)).
- A description of the research activities you will conduct with the data (Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(f)).
- A summary for publication: research topic; the data provider (VLOP/VLOSE) from which data are requested; and a description of the requested data (Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(g)).

If personal data are involved or higher-security access is needed, include the following (as applicable)
- Risk assessment for processing personal data (e.g., a DPIA where applicable) and the envisaged technical and organisational measures (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(a); see also Recital 15).
- Relevant security controls: network security, encryption, access control, backup, integrity, and incident response (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(b)).
- Storage period and data destruction plans, where applicable (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(c)).
- Organisational measures: internal review processes, access restrictions, and information-sharing controls (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(d)).
- Any proposed contractual clauses (e.g., NDAs, data agreements) setting conditions of access/processing (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(e)).
- Evidence of training received on data security and personal-data protection by the applicant researchers (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(4)(f)).
- If a secure processing environment will be used, documentation showing the operator meets the required conditions (Delegated Reg. Art. 9(5)).

Substantive eligibility your application must demonstrate
- Your project’s purpose fits DSA Article 40(4): it contributes to detecting, identifying and understanding systemic risks in the Union and/or assessing the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of platforms’ risk-mitigation measures (DSA Art. 40(4); Art. 40(8)(f)).
- You are capable of meeting data security and confidentiality requirements and protecting personal data with appropriate technical and organisational measures (DSA Art. 40(8)(d); Delegated Reg. Art. 8(1)(e)).

Where and how to submit
- Submit a data access application to the DSC of establishment, or to the DSC of the Member State of your research organisation; the latter will conduct an initial assessment and forward it to the DSC of establishment (DSA Art. 40(9)).
- Use the DSA data access portal, which serves as the central digital point for the data access process and exchanges among researchers, data providers and DSCs (Delegated Reg. Art. 3(2)(b)).

Personal data you will typically provide in the portal
- Identity data (e.g., name, user ID), contact information (address, email), and documentation proving affiliation to a research organisation; only what is necessary and proportionate is processed (Delegated Reg. Art. 5(1), 5(3)(a)-(c)).

Notes
- Platforms must facilitate access for vetted researchers via appropriate interfaces once a reasoned request is issued (DSA Art. 40(7)).
- If your work only needs publicly accessible data, platforms must give access without undue delay to such data to researchers who meet DSA Art. 40(8)(b)-(e) (independence, funding disclosure, security/confidentiality capability, and necessity/proportionality) (DSA Art. 40(12)).
