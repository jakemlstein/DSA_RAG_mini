Subject: Application for Access to Platform Data under the Digital Services Act (DSA) - Research Project on "Filter Bubbles"

To the Data Access Team, Facebook/Meta Platforms,


This application seeks access to relevant platform data from Facebook under the provisions of the Digital Services Act (DSA) for a research project focused on understanding and analyzing exposure to "filter bubbles."

**1. Researcher and Institutional Details:**
*   **Researcher Name:** [Your Full Name]
*   **Affiliation:** [Your Academic/Research Institution Name]
*   **Department/Faculty:** [Your Department/Faculty]
*   **Contact Information:** [Your Email Address, Phone Number]
*   **Institutional Address:** [Institution's Full Address]
*   **Role/Position:** [e.g., Lead Researcher, PhD Candidate, Postdoctoral Fellow]
*   **Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee Approval:** [Reference Number and Date of Approval, if applicable, or statement of intent to seek approval]

**2. Research Proposal - Studying "Filter Bubbles":**
*   **Project Title:** Investigating Exposure to "Filter Bubbles" and Information Diversity on Facebook
*   **Research Objectives:**
    *   To identify and quantify the prevalence of "filter bubbles" experienced by users on the Facebook platform.
    *   To analyze the mechanisms and algorithmic processes that contribute to the formation and reinforcement of these "filter bubbles."
    *   To assess the impact of "filter bubbles" on users' exposure to diverse information and perspectives.
    *   To explore the demographic and behavioral characteristics of users who are more or less susceptible to "filter bubble" phenomena.
    *   To inform policy recommendations and platform design improvements aimed at mitigating the negative effects of "filter bubbles."
*   **Research Questions (Examples):**
    *   How does the Facebook algorithm influence the diversity of news and information presented to individual users?
    *   What are the measurable differences in information exposure between users with varying network structures and engagement patterns?
    *   Do specific content types (e.g., political news, health information) exhibit stronger "filter bubble" effects than others?
    *   What is the correlation between user engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) and the reinforcement of existing informational biases?
*   **Proposed Methodology:**
    *   **Data Collection Strategy:** [Describe your approach, e.g., analyzing user interaction data, content consumption patterns, network connections. Emphasize aggregated and anonymized data where possible.]
    *   **Analytical Techniques:** [e.g., statistical analysis, network analysis, content analysis, machine learning for pattern detection.]
    *   **Timeline:** [Brief overview of project phases and expected duration.]

**3. Justification for Data Access:**
*   **Necessity of Facebook Data:** Access to Facebook's platform data is indispensable for this research due to its unparalleled scale and the critical role it plays in shaping public discourse and individual information diets. The internal mechanisms of content distribution and user interaction are not externally observable, making direct data access crucial for an accurate and comprehensive study of "filter bubbles."
*   **Proportionality:** The requested data will be strictly limited to what is necessary to answer the outlined research questions, focusing on aggregated and anonymized metrics and patterns rather than individual user identities, to ensure proportionality and minimize privacy impact.
*   **Contribution to Systemic Risk Understanding:** This research directly addresses a systemic risk identified under the DSA â€“ the potential for platform design and algorithmic curation to contribute to societal polarization and the spread of misinformation by limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints. Our findings will provide valuable insights into these risks and inform strategies for their mitigation.

**4. Data Protection and Security Measures:**
*   **Data Handling Protocol:** All accessed data will be treated with the highest standards of data protection and privacy.
*   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** A robust plan for anonymization or pseudonymization will be implemented prior to analysis, ensuring that individual users cannot be identified from the research outputs.
*   **Secure Storage:** Data will be stored on secure, institutionally approved servers with restricted access, employing encryption and other state-of-the-art security protocols.
*   **Access Control:** Access to the data will be strictly limited to the approved research team members, with clear roles and responsibilities defined.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only the minimum necessary data required for the research objectives will be requested and retained.
*   **Compliance:** The research will adhere to all applicable data protection regulations, including GDPR and any specific requirements outlined by the DSA and Facebook.

**5. Ethical Considerations:**
*   **Ethical Review:** The project will undergo or has undergone rigorous ethical review by [Your Institution's IRB/Ethics Committee] to ensure compliance with ethical research principles.
*   **Public Benefit:** The research is driven by a clear public interest, aiming to generate knowledge that can benefit users, platforms, and policymakers in fostering a more informed and diverse online information environment.
*   **Transparency:** Research findings will be disseminated responsibly and transparently, contributing to academic discourse and public understanding of platform dynamics.
*   **Non-Maleficence:** Every effort will be made to ensure that the research process and its outcomes do not cause harm to individuals or groups.

**6. Requested Data Scope (Example - Specifics to be discussed):**
*   Aggregated and anonymized data on content consumption patterns (e.g., types of content viewed, sources accessed).
*   Data on user interactions with content (e.g., likes, shares, comments) at an aggregated level.
*   Anonymized network structure data (e.g., connections between users, community affiliations).
*   Algorithmic exposure logs (if available and anonymized) related to content recommendations.
*   Demographic metadata (aggregated and anonymized) to analyze varying "filter bubble" effects across different user groups.

We are prepared to collaborate with Facebook's data access team to refine the scope of data requested and ensure all legal and technical requirements are met. We look forward to your positive consideration of this application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
